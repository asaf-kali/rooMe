# rooMe
This project is part of the WORKSHOP IN SOFTWARE AND UX course. The rooMe app is written in android studio.
RooMe's is an easy app-based platform with the main purpose of connecting between poeple searching for roommates for their apartment and poeple searching to join an apartment. 
A user of the app can choose to be one of the two (either search for an apartment or a roommate) when first signing in.

Apartment searcher:
Home: This user sees all apartments relevant to his preferences (filters) that are searching for a roommate.
Edit profile: The user is advised to fill up his profile page entirely, for the roommate searchers see this data of his and it
is also a filtering data for the roommate searchers. For example-roommate searchers may want roommates above a certain age so this is a filter taken from the apartment searchers' profile.
Edit filters: The user is highly advised to fill these filters for they have a great influence on the apartments the user sees in his/hers home page.
Matches: In this tab the user will see apartments for which their owners (roommate searcher) have approved his request (sent as a like from the home tab). For privacy reasons, the phone number of each user is only seen when matched so they would be able to contact one another only after mutual approvement.

Roommate searcher:
Home: This user sees all apartment searchers relevant to his preferences (filters).
Edit profile: The user is advised to fill up his profile page entirely, for the apartment searchers see this data and it
is also a filtering data for the apartment searchers. For example-apartment searchers may want apartments in a certain location so this is a filter taken from the rommate searchers' profile.
Edit filters: The user is highly advised to fill these filters for they have a great influence on the roommate searchers the user sees in his/hers home page.
Matches: In this tab the user will see roommate searcher profiles which their request (sent as a like from the home tab) was approved. For privacy reasons, the phone number of each user is only seen when matched so they would be able to contact one another only after mutual approvement.
****NOTE! this part was not fully implemented due to short time. Therefore, we left some classes and xml files related to this part although not fully implemented. This is because we would like to continue this ap in the future. ****
